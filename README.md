# Roomba
Hello World! 

This project is not much to look at, but served as something that made me know I wanted to pursue software, so I may revisit this and 
make a much better version in the future as a fun little project. I appologize for the lack of advanced software technique or 
evident lack of standards in my code. This was my first "real" project in C or in software at all!

Background:
My grandpa lives in Arizona and we went to visit him over christmas break. It was awesome we explored the desert and climbed a mountain together.
On christmas my parents had given him a gift, it was a roomba. My grandma and grandpa were really excited and I thought it was kinda cool.
I would sit on the couch w/ my grandparents and talk to them as we watched the roomba move around. After a few hours of this, I said, "I bet I can build
that". My grandpa then challenged me to recreate a roomba. The result of that challenge is my code that ran my bot! 

I made this as a Senior in high school so it's not too good, but I also built the robot from scratch w/ a lasercut frame! 

It wasn't very EPIC, but it inspired me!

Anyways, this is more for documentation to improve upon in the future once I learn more about C at University!

Will also probably have to build my own circuitry this time around too!
